### Migration Guide

#### From 0.9.x to 1.0.0

1. **Backup existing data**:
   ```bash
   kubectl exec -it postgres-pod -- pg_dump houston_oil_airs > backup.sql
   ```

2. **Update deployment method**:
   ```bash
   # Old method
   kubectl apply -f deployment/

   # New method
   ./deploy.sh production
   ```

3. **Update configuration**:
   - Move environment variables to Helm values
   - Update secret management approach
   - Configure monitoring endpoints

4. **Verify migration**:
   ```bash
   make validate
   kubectl get pods -n houston-oil-airs
   ```

### Breaking Changes

#### Configuration Changes
- Environment variables moved to Helm values
- Secret management now uses Kubernetes secrets
- Database connection strings updated

#### API Changes
- Health check endpoints standardized
- Metrics endpoint moved to `/metrics`
- Authentication headers updated

#### Deployment Changes
- Kubernetes manifests replaced with Helm charts
- Environment-specific configurations use Kustomize
- Infrastructure provisioning requires Terraform

### Upgrade Instructions

#### Automated Upgrade
```bash
# Backup current deployment
kubectl get all -n houston-oil-airs -o yaml > backup.yaml

# Deploy new version
./deploy.sh production

# Verify upgrade
make validate
```

#### Manual Upgrade
1. Update Helm chart values
2. Run database migrations
3. Update monitoring configuration
4. Test all endpoints
5. Update documentation

### Known Issues
