# Professional Standards and Ethics

Houston Oil Airs maintains a research environment characterized by intellectual rigor, mutual respect, and ethical integrity. This document outlines the standards to which all participants in our community are expected to adhere.

## Core Principles

### Research Integrity
- Maintain transparency in methodologies, limitations, and conflicts of interest
- Acknowledge the contributions of others with appropriate citation
- Present findings that reflect data accuracy, regardless of desired outcomes
- Distinguish clearly between established facts, working hypotheses, and speculative thinking

### Professional Interaction
- Challenge ideas rather than individuals
- Recognize that critique strengthens research when delivered constructively
- Value diverse perspectives as essential to comprehensive understanding
- Maintain confidentiality when reviewing unpublished work

### Inclusive Excellence
- Evaluate contributions based solely on their substantive merit
- Recognize that diversity of thought derives from diversity of experience
- Ensure accessibility of events, publications, and digital resources
- Create conditions where traditionally underrepresented voices can participate fully

### Responsible Technology Advocacy
- Consider potential misapplications of research findings
- Acknowledge the differential impact of technologies across population segments
- Resist oversimplification of complex sociotechnical realities
- Prioritize human welfare in all technological recommendations

## Implementation

Houston Oil Airs upholds these standards through:

1. Transparent review processes for research proposals and publications
2. Regular ethics training for all research affiliates
3. Anonymous reporting mechanisms for standards violations
4. An ethics committee empowered to investigate concerns

## Enforcement

Violations of these standards may result in:
