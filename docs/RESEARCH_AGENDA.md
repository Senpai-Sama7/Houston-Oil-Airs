# Research Agenda 2025-2027

## Strategic Research Direction

Houston Oil Airs approaches artificial intelligence research through a multidisciplinary lens, prioritizing work that addresses the sociotechnical challenges of AI deployment with intellectual rigor and ethical forethought. Our agenda deliberately spans theoretical foundations and practical applications, creating a comprehensive framework for responsible innovation.

## Priority Research Areas

### 1. Alignment & Intent Engineering

**Central Question:** How can we ensure AI systems operate in accordance with human values and intentions?

**Current Initiatives:**
- Developing formal metrics for quantifying alignment between stated objectives and emergent behaviors
- Investigating prompt engineering techniques that constrain model responses within ethical boundaries
- Analyzing the relationship between training data composition and resulting model alignment
- Researching fine-tuning methodologies that preserve alignment across domain adaptations

### 2. Fairness & Representational Integrity

**Central Question:** How do we establish robust fairness criteria across diverse contexts and communities?

**Current Initiatives:**
- Constructing evaluation frameworks that account for contextual variations in fairness requirements
- Developing methodologies to identify and remediate representational harms in generative outputs
- Researching the impact of data provenance on fairness outcomes across different demographic groups
- Examining fairness trade-offs between different stakeholder interests in deployed AI systems

### 3. Interdisciplinary Integration

**Central Question:** How can insights from adjacent disciplines strengthen responsible AI development?

**Current Initiatives:**
- Synthesizing cognitive science research on human conceptual development to improve AI reasoning capabilities
- Applying sociolinguistic frameworks to understand contextual appropriateness in language generation
- Engaging philosophical perspectives on value alignment and moral uncertainty
- Developing cross-disciplinary methodological standards for AI evaluation

### 4. Interpretability & Transparency Mechanisms

**Central Question:** How can we render AI systems' decision processes intelligible to human overseers?

**Current Initiatives:**
- Developing novel visualization techniques for neural network activations
- Researching methods to extract and validate latent knowledge representations
- Creating frameworks for mechanistic explanations of emergent capabilities
- Examining the relationship between interpretability and effective human oversight

### 5. Adversarial Resilience & Misuse Prevention

**Central Question:** How can AI systems be hardened against intentional manipulation and misuse?

**Current Initiatives:**
- Developing sophisticated red-teaming methodologies for proactive vulnerability assessment
- Researching detection mechanisms for synthetic content across modalities
- Examining the efficacy of various safety interventions against determined adversaries
- Establishing frameworks for responsible disclosure of discovered vulnerabilities

### 6. Capability Mapping & Model Exploration

**Central Question:** How can we systematically characterize the boundaries of AI capabilities?

**Current Initiatives:**
- Developing taxonomies of generative model capabilities across domains
- Researching emergent abilities that appear only at certain model scales
- Mapping the relationship between training regimes and resulting capability distributions
- Creating standardized evaluation frameworks for cross-model comparison

### 7. Robustness Engineering

**Central Question:** How can we ensure AI system performance remains reliable across varied conditions?

**Current Initiatives:**
- Researching invariance properties across linguistic and contextual perturbations
- Developing worst-case guarantees for safety-critical applications
- Examining the relationship between data diversity and model robustness
- Creating formal verification methods for neural network properties
