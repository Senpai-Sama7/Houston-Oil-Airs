# Research Ethics Framework

## Foundational Principles

Houston Oil Airs' research ethics framework establishes the moral architecture that guides our scientific inquiry. This framework reflects our commitment to advancing AI research that prioritizes human flourishing while recognizing the unique ethical challenges presented by increasingly capable AI systems.

## Core Ethical Commitments

### 1. Anticipatory Governance

We recognize that responsible research requires foresight. Research teams must:

- Conduct thorough risk assessment before project initiation
- Establish clear protocols for unexpected capabilities or results
- Develop contingency plans for potentially harmful discoveries
- Engage in ongoing monitoring throughout the research lifecycle

### 2. Proportional Safeguards

The degree of oversight increases in proportion to potential impact. Research involving:

- Significant capability advancement requires external ethical review
- Novel generalization abilities requires enhanced monitoring protocols
- Potential dual-use applications requires stakeholder consultation
- Safety-critical domains requires phased testing protocols

### 3. Epistemic Humility

We acknowledge the limitations of our predictive capabilities regarding AI systems:

- Research designs must accommodate uncertainty in outcomes
- Claims must be calibrated to available evidence
- Methodological limitations must be explicitly documented
- Alternative interpretations must be considered and addressed

### 4. Stakeholder Inclusion

Research affecting diverse communities requires appropriate representation:

- Research design should include affected community consultation
- Evaluation criteria should reflect diverse stakeholder concerns
- Potential differential impacts must be systematically assessed
- Distribution of benefits and harms must be explicitly considered

## Implementation Mechanisms

### Ethics Review Process

All research conducted under Houston Oil Airs auspices undergoes tiered review:

**Tier 1: Self-Assessment**  
Researchers complete the Ethics Impact Assessment questionnaire to identify potential concerns.

**Tier 2: Peer Consultation**  
Research proposals with moderate ethical considerations undergo structured peer discussion.

**Tier 3: Ethics Committee Review**  
Projects with significant ethical dimensions require formal committee evaluation.

### Ongoing Monitoring

Research ethics extends beyond initial approval:

- Quarterly ethical reflection sessions for all active projects
- Incident reporting system for unexpected outcomes
- Regular stakeholder feedback incorporation
- External audit for high-impact research streams

### Ethical Disagreement Protocol

When facing ethical uncertainty or disagreement, we employ:

- Structured ethical deliberation methodology
- Multi-perspective analysis framework
- External expert consultation when appropriate
- Documented decision rationale preservation

## Application to Research Areas

Our ethics framework applies distinctively across our research domains:

### Alignment Research

- Maintain critical awareness of whose values are operationalized
- Acknowledge plurality of legitimate human values
- Document value assumptions explicitly
- Consider alignment stability across contexts

### Fairness & Representation

- Problematize universal fairness definitions
- Document trade-offs between competing fairness criteria
- Consider historical context of representational harms
- Engage affected communities in evaluation design

### Interpretability & Transparency

- Balance transparency against potential misuse
- Consider accessibility of explanations across expertise levels
- Acknowledge limitations of current interpretability methods
- Distinguish between different stakeholder transparency needs

### Robustness & Safety

- Prioritize risk assessment for vulnerable populations
- Consider adversarial testing ethical boundaries
- Document identified vulnerabilities responsibly
- Develop appropriate disclosure protocols

By adhering to this framework, Houston Oil Airs demonstrates our commitment to conducting research that advances knowledge while respecting fundamental ethical principles. This document serves as a living instrument, subject to regular review and refinement as our understanding of AI ethics evolves.
