## 🛠️ Changes Made

### Critical Security Fixes (P1-P2)
1. **Removed Hardcoded Passwords** ✅
   - File: `backend/node-server/test/server.integration.test.js`
   - Changed: Hardcoded `'ej_ai_2024'` → `process.env.TEST_DB_PASSWORD`
   - Impact: Prevents credential exposure in version control

2. **Enforced Environment Variables** ✅
   - File: `backend/node-server/src/server.js`
   - Changed: Default fallback → Throws error if not set
   - Impact: Fail-closed security prevents misconfiguration

3. **Updated Environment Example** ✅
   - File: `.env.example`
   - Added: `TEST_DB_PASSWORD` documentation
   - Changed: Default password → `your_secure_password_here`

### Documentation Enhancements
4. **README Aesthetic Enhancement** ✅
   - Applied consistent styling throughout all sections
   - Added emojis, improved formatting, enhanced readability
   - Added contextual descriptions and use cases
   - Improved visual hierarchy and section organization

5. **Comprehensive Audit Report** ✅
   - Created: `docs/COMPREHENSIVE_CODEBASE_AUDIT.md`
   - 20,000+ words covering all findings
   - P1-P4 severity classification
   - Actionable solutions with code examples

6. **Improvement Roadmap** ✅
   - Created: `docs/CODE_QUALITY_IMPROVEMENT_ROADMAP.md`
   - Detailed implementation guides for P3-P4 items
   - Timeline and success criteria
   - Testing strategies
