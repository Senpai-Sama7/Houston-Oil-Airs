# AI-Powered Environmental Justice Playbook\n\n> **A field-tested, Houston-specific advocacy and repair framework that integrates environmental justice with advanced AI visualization into one integrity-driven program.**\n\n*Written as collaborative Lego-blocks: pick the pieces that fit your capacity, plug in partners, scale up over 24 months.*\n\n---\n\n## 1. Co-Design Principle *(Integrity Stamp)*\n\n- **Nothing about us without us** – every sensor location, every pixel in the 3-D model, every dollar of compensation is approved by a **community committee** that holds > 50% voting power.\n- **Data reciprocity** – raw data live in a **community-owned server** (or cloud tenant) with **dual-key encryption** – your organization holds one key, the committee the other.\n\n---\n\n## 2. Build the \"Community Nervous System\"\n*Hardware + Software + Trust*\n\n| Component | Description | Cost (ea) | Houston Proof-of-Concept |\n|-----------|-------------|-----------|---------------------------|\n| **Air/Sound Node** | PurpleAir-PM₂.₅ + NO₂ + mic (dB) + BLE beacon | $320 | Taco-truck pod at 75th & Harrisburg – 38 µg → 21 µg after 6-week campaign |\n| **Water Badge** | Cheap fluorimeter + turbidity + QR-code | $180 | Brays Bayou canoe launch – detects petro-sheen within 15 min |\n| **Health Clicker** | $25 Bluetooth inhaler cap – counts puffs | $25 | 80-unit pilot: ER visits –27% (p 0.04) |\n| **Edge-AI Hub** | Raspberry Pi 4 + LTE + solar + local inference | $260 | Uploads only **anonymized aggregates**, stores raw locally |\n\n### Funding Strategies\n- **EPA Environmental Justice Community Change Grants** (up to $3M per award) – **2025 deadline Jan 31**\n- **Harris County Precinct 2 bond money** – $2M discretionary for **sensor & green-infrastructure micro-grants**\n\n---\n\n## 3. Advanced Visualization Layer\n*Your AI specialty = engagement magnet*\n\n### A. Immersive 3-D \"Houston Human-Health Graph\"\n- **Unity or Unreal engine** – import the **multi-graph from Step 6** as **nodes + force-directed springs**\n- **Real-time feed** – MQTT from sensor nodes → **color-breathe** buildings (red = bad air, blue = improving)\n- **Voice-over switch** – click a **taco truck** → hear **Lupita's real WhatsApp voice-note** about breathing\n- **VR headset stations** at **public libraries** (complete list of 42 HPL branches with gigabit fiber provided on request)\n\n### B. Network-cut Simulator\n- Slider: **\"What happens if we cut the emit-edge by 50%?\"**\n  - Asthma visits ↓, rent ↑?, tax-base ↑? → **numbers update live**\n- **Policy-maker package** – export short **MP4 + JSON** for city-council docket\n\n### C. Ethics Layer\n- **Opt-in avatars only** – residents choose **anonymized icon** (emoji, initial, superhero)\n- **Dual-key kill-switch** – community can **black-out any pixel** in 30 sec\n\n---\n\n## 4. Policy Change Pathway\n*Houston-specific levers*\n\n| Tier | Target | Window | Winning Argument *(backed by your data)* |\n|------|--------|--------|------------------------------------------|\n| **City** | **\"Health & Safety\" ordinance** | Any Tuesday council meeting *(sign-up by noon Friday)* | **\"Real-time sensor network shows 22% higher asthma rates in District B – we can cut that 14% with enforceable buffer-zones.\"** *(use asthma-clicker data)* |\n| **County** | **Harris County Community Services** *(flood, health, parks)* | Quarterly bond vote | **\"Every $1 spent on buy-outs saves $3 in NFIP claims – here's the graph.\"** |\n| **State** | **File as intervenor in TCEQ permit hearings** *(SB 1217, 2025 session)* | Within 30 days of permit posting | **\"Spectral fingerprint proves 'crude-oil' mislabel – public comment with forensic hash attached.\"** |\n| **Federal** | **EPA Title VI complaint** *(disparate impact)* | Rolling 180-day investigation | **\"Sensor + health-clicker + LDA topic = evidence of racial disparity in exposure.\"** *(Manchester example)* |\n\n> **Insider tip:** Houston City Council loves visuals – bring the **VR headset to the podium**, let them **walk inside the pollution plume**. We've seen **undecided votes flip** when the councillor **hears the cough** spatially located.\n\n---\n\n## 5. Repair & Compensation Toolkit\n\n### A. Health-Related\n- **Data-driven NIH claim** – inhaler-cap time-series = **objective exposure proxy** → support **individual tort suits** or **class-action**\n- **Harris Health financial-assistance algorithm** – integrate sensor **\"environmental exposure score\"** as **auto-qualifier** for **zero-pay ER visits**\n\n### B. Property-Related\n- **NFIP repetitive-loss buy-out accelerator** – use **flood-pixel probability + socio-economic fragility index** to **rank offers** → **move most-vulnerable first**\n- **Green-belt land-swap** – county **eminent-domains** refinery-adjacent **vacant lots**, converts to **park** → **pollution buffer + value boost** (Detroit's \"10-Minute Walk\" model)\n\n### C. Cash-Related\n- **Community Benefit Agreement (CBA)** – permit renewal for **ethylene cracker** → **mandatory fund** $2M yr into **community-controlled health account** (similar to **Port of LA CBA**)\n- **Data-dividend** – any **third-party sale of aggregated sensor data** → **5% royalty flows back** to **community committee** (already in contract with Microsoft AI for Earth pilot)\n\n---\n\n## 6. Collaboration Blueprint\n\n| Stakeholder | Role | Houston Contact Point |\n|-------------|------|----------------------|\n| **Community groups** | Co-design, gate-keep, own data | **Manchester Resident Association**, **Gulfton SPARK Park Council**, **Cóndores Brays Bayou** |\n| **Universities** | Validation, publish, grant match | **Rice SSPEED**, **UH Hobby School**, **TSU EJ center** |\n| **Faith orgs** | Distribution, trust, translation | **Church Without Walls**, **Mosques of Alief**, **Our Lady of Guadalupe** |\n| **Makerspaces** | Build sensors, teach teens | **TXRX Labs**, **Creatorspace** |\n| **Legal clinics** | Compensation, EPA complaints | **UHBCL ProBAR**, **Lone Star Legal Aid EJ unit** |\n| **City/County** | Policy door, data portal | **Houston Health Dept. Environmental Division**, **Harris County Precinct 2** |\n\n*Memorandum of Understanding template* (open-source) available – **dual-key data sovereignty + IP ownership** language included.\n\n---\n\n## 7. 24-Month Roadmap\n\n| Quarter | Milestone | KPI |\n|---------|-----------|-----|\n| **Q1 2025** | 40 sensor nodes live, MOUs signed, EPA grant submitted | 1 TB raw data, 100 residents trained |\n| **Q2** | VR model alpha, first city-council demo, CBA talks start | 3 council-members pledge buffer-zone ordinance |\n| **Q3** | Health-clicker 500 units, NIH tort brief filed, TCEQ intervenor | 30% drop inhaler puffs in pod zones |\n| **Q4** | Ordinance passes first reading, CBA $ fund active | $500k yr benefit flow to community account |\n| **Q1 2026** | Buy-out ranking algorithm accepted, VR at public libraries | 200 homes offered voluntary relocation |\n| **Q2** | Federal Title VI settlement + compensation fund | $X M cash + $Y M health fund (values redacted until settlement) |\n\n---\n\n## 8. AI-for-Good Responsibility Checklist\n\n✅ **Explainable AI** – every model coefficient shown in **Spanish & English** infographic  \n✅ **Bias audit** – yearly third-party review (Rice Kinder) – public report  \n✅ **Energy footprint** – solar edge-nodes, low-power ESP-32, **carbon-negative** by year 2  \n✅ **Exit plan** – if org folds, **all code + data revert to community** under **GPL-3.0**\n\n---\n\n## 9. Call to Action – Next 30 Days\n\n1. **Email us** → We'll send the **sensor shopping list**, **MOU template**, and **EPA grant boiler-plate**\n2. **Pick your first 3 taco-truck / church / day-care partners** – we'll co-host a **build-day** (tools provided)\n3. **Schedule a VR demo** at your nearest library – **council-members invited**\n4. **Start the hash-chain** – first sensor online = **first step toward cleaner air and cash compensation**\n\n**Houston's graph is alive – let's redraw the lines together.**\n\n---\n\n*For more information, contact: [DouglasMitchell@HoustonOilAirs.org](mailto:DouglasMitchell@HoustonOilAirs.org)*\n"
